              </p>
              <p><b>ANOTHER </b> major advantage of “Distance Learning” is that you can obtain admission in any number of Courses from anywhere in the world.</p>
              <p><b>ONE </b> thing about “DL” is that you would not have to face major competition from fellow students. If you are a slow learner, distance learning would be perfect for you. As distance learning promotes self-paced learning, you can take your own time to learn and complete the course.
